# PhD Thesis Lab Notebook

This repository is a **public lab notebook** documenting my PhD research activities.
It complements my analysis pipelines (stored in separate repositories) by keeping
a trace of experiments, troubleshooting, decisions, and methodological notes.

## Purpose
- Document analyses performed during the PhD
- Record errors, limitations, and solutions encountered
- Centralize methodological notes reusable across projects
- Ensure transparency and reproducibility (public-safe content only)

## What this repository contains
- Run logs (commands, parameters, summaries)
- Troubleshooting notes
- Method descriptions
- Lightweight outputs (figures, tables)

## What this repository does NOT contain
- Raw sequencing data
- Large databases (e.g. Kraken2 DB)
- Sensitive paths, credentials, or identifiers

## Related pipelines
